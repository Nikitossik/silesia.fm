# silesia.fm simple website (front-end only)
A modern version of silesia.fm website (Silesia 96.2 station).
- **This website is just my front-end vision of a modern radio station design made from scratch based on popular radio stations websites**
-  **There are no pages that contain contact information, regulations, history and any other information related to a particular station**
-  **This website has only 1 example of a show or podcast page, just for demonstration** 

## [Live preview](https://nikitossik.github.io/silesia.fm/)

## Tech stack
The project is made with pure HTML, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), Vanilla JS and additional libraries: 
- [Flowbite js component library](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Swiper slider](https://swiperjs.com/)
- Built with [Vite](https://v3.vitejs.dev/)

# Page description
## Main page 
![screenshot of a main page](/screenshots/homepage.png)

This page contains: 
- header with currently playing show and a button for interactive player (displays on every page)
- sidebar with a menu with links to other pages (displays on every page)
- sliders with several links to shows, podcasts and events. The link "Zobacz wszystkie" leads to all items page

## Player
![screenshot of a player](/screenshots/player.png)

- The idea behind the player is that the user can listen to a current music, or podcast or show white browsing a page.
- Player shows the current state (play/pause) and the incoming show.
- To demonstrate, I added an example song you can listen by clicking the button
